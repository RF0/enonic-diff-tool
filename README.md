Helps to diff various Enonic CMS installations

When working with big installations, where production, test and development environments are present
and multiple developers are working at the same time, it's nice to know what's happening. Our diff tool
shows a possible solution to track changes and visualize differences.


Read documentation in the article [Enonic Diff Tool](http://labs.enonic.com/articles/a-diff-tool "Enonic Diff Tool").

NB! Enonic Diff Tool depends upon cms-shell's extract tool that is Enterprise version only.
